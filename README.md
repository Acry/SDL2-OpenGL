### This is a starter series about GLSL Shaders using SDL2 as OpenGL Helper and a bit Shader-Language for C-Coders.

0 - Init a simple OpenGL Window  
1 - Draw and rotate rectangles  
2 - Working with shaders  
3 - Load a [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) shader  

When working with shaders use left mouse button and mouse motion to change view.  
When working with multiple shaders use middle mouse button to switch shaders.
